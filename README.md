# Project_3-PopcornTime:
This is the Project for the 4th week as a data science student in Ironhack Madrid. The goal for this project is to put into practice everything I've learned so far with special emphasis on obtaining data through the use of APIs.

# 1. What did I do?:
For the development of this task, I started with the extraction of a dataset composed by IMDB's details about movies from the 1920s until today. 
Parting from this data I was able to obtain some significant indicators of the cinematic economic situation throughout history(budgets, worldwide income, profit ratios, etc.).
For the enrichment of the dataset I introduced an API which retrieves different images for the movies. I think it contributes to the visual insight of the data.
Finally I built a program as a .py file which works as a search engine thoughout the dataset. Description below:

# 2. Main.py description:
The program consists of a search engine in which you have to input two parameters:

-t : Type of search you want to use. with this command you have to choose the method to search one or more movies(by title, director, actor, year,        worldwide_income)

-m : with this command you assign what characters to search in the previous category(chosen -t) for example: -t 'title -m 'hobbi' will find the three movies with hobbit in its title

# 3. Tools:

Python
Pandas
Numpy
Regex
Requests
Argparse
APIs
